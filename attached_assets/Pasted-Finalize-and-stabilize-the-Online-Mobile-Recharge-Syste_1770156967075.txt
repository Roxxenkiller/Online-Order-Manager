Finalize and stabilize the Online Mobile Recharge System as a complete full-stack web application.

Scope confirmation:
- This is a full application (not just UI).
- Recharge plans are FIXED and seeded; admin does NOT manage or disable plans.

Requirements to complete in this single pass:

1. Authentication
- Use the existing Replit login flow.
- Maintain session-based authentication.
- Identify admin by matching logged-in user email with ADMIN_EMAIL environment variable.

2. User Features (logged-in):
- Browse recharge plans (Top-Up and Special).
- Perform mobile recharge (mock payment).
- Pay postpaid bills using the mock bill API.
- Generate and display a clear transaction receipt after payment.
- Activate/deactivate services:
  • Do Not Disturb
  • Caller Tune
- View personal recharge and bill payment history.
- Edit personal profile details.

3. Guest Features:
- Browse recharge plans.
- Perform online recharge as guest.
- Submit feedback.

4. Admin Panel (admin email only):
- Dashboard overview (daily summary).
- View all transactions by date.
- View registered users list.
- View feedback submissions.
- Admin access must be blocked for non-admin users.

5. Backend & Database:
- Use the existing PostgreSQL schema.
- Ensure APIs work correctly:
  • /api/plans
  • /api/recharges
  • /api/bills/:mobileNumber
  • /api/bill-payments
  • /api/feedback
  • /api/admin/*
- Ensure proper validation (especially 10-digit mobile numbers).
- Add clear comments to all major code blocks.

6. Frontend:
- Ensure all required pages exist and are linked via navigation:
  Home, Online Recharge, My Account, Postpaid Bill Payment, Feedback, About Us, Contact Us, Customer Care.
- Frontend must correctly call backend APIs.
- Show success/error messages clearly.

7. Quality & Completion:
- Do NOT add new features beyond this scope.
- Do NOT redesign UI unnecessarily.
- Focus on correctness, stability, and project completeness.
- Ensure the app runs cleanly in Preview without errors.

Complete everything in one pass and leave the project in a submission-ready state.
